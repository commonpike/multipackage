It uses `make` for the workflow to combine both `composer` and `npm`.

That requires 
- make
- npm
- composer
- npx

## make commands

- make install\
  calls composer install, npm install, etc

- make compile 
  - make compile-css\
    using node, compiles sass to css in `src/assets/css`

  - make compile-html\
    using php, compiles twig to html in `src/docs/html`

- make packages \
  copies files to various `/build/(package)`

- make release [type=$type]\
  calls `npm version $type && npm publish` to github for each package \
  type = patch|minor|major

- make clean \
  remove generated files in `/build/(package)`, `src/assets/css` and `src/docs/html`
